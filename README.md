# Flying-Planner
This is a project I had done in 2nd year, that involves designing a Flying Planner in Java.
# How it works
There are 2 parts to this program:

The FlyingPlannerMainPartA.java asks the user to enter the starting airport, and the final destination from 5 specific airports. The user has to enter 1 of the 5 airport names specified. The program then displays the shortest path between the 2 airports, and the cost of the shortest path.

The FlyingPlanner.java involves a more substantial graph, which consists of the list of airports from the airports.csv file. The program asks the user to enter the starting airport, and the final destination. The user has to enter the airport code for each, given in the airports.csv file. The program then displays the shortest path between the 2 airports, the total journey cost and the total time in air.
